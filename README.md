# Arath Ramírez

This GitHub documents my work on applied automation, AI-assisted systems, and behavioral experimentation.

## Focus

My work is centered on:
- building and testing AI-assisted workflows
- designing automation to reduce friction in real contexts
- experimenting with decision-making and behavioral patterns
- documenting reasoning, failures, and trade-offs

## Repository structure

This account is organized around three main repositories:

- **experiments**  
  Applied experiments, prototypes, and exploratory work.  
  Includes incomplete or failed attempts with documented lessons.

- **systems**  
  Practical tools and automation used in real workflows.  
  Focused on reliability, constraints, and real-world use.

- **notes**  
  Technical notes and reasoning.  
  Used as an external memory for concepts, patterns, and insights.

## Philosophy

- Clarity over polish  
- Documentation over performance  
- Systems over tools  

This repository is maintained as a long-term technical record.
